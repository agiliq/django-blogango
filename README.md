### To quickly try it locally


    cd django-blogango/example/  
    pip install -r ../requirements.txt  
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver

Create a Blog instance at `/admin/blogango/blog/add/`. The Blog instance is required for storing blog wide settings, like, number of entries to show per page, title for the blog, tag line for the blog etc.

With Blog instance created, you will be able to access `/blog/`. At this point, no blog entries exist. Create a blog entry at `/admin/blogango/blogentry/add/`.

With a blog entry created, you would be able to see the entry at `/blog/`.
